# Element CLI

The [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for developing and managing building [blocks](https://github.com/volusion/element-tutorial) for the next generation of [Volusion](https://www.volusion.com) storefronts

## Installing

After [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), run

```bash
npm install -g @volusion/element-cli
```

## Using the CLI

### `element login`

The command for logging into the Element ecosystem. This is necessary for publishing and updating [blocks](https://github.com/volusion/element-tutorial#vocabulary).

Use the same credentials you use to log into your [Volusion store admin](https://admin.volusion.com). You may optionally pass in username from the command line:  `element --username email@email.com`

* * *

### `element new NAME`

The command for scaffolding a new block. The command will clone the [Element Block Starter repo](https://github.com/volusion/element-blockstarter), allowing you to quickly get started with your development process. The NAME passed in will be converted to PascalCase.

* * *

### `element publish --name "A NAME TO DISPLAY TO USERS" --category "OPTIONAL CATEGORY" --new-major`

From the root directory of the block you intend to eventually make available to users of the Site Designer on the [Volusion store admin](https://admin.volusion.com).

Publishing your first block also will create a v1 branch to manage the version code base.

By default, _newly-published blocks will only be visible to you and the other members of your organization_.

In the event that a `-c/--category` flag is not passed, you will be prompted with a list of valid Category names from which to select.

If you pass `-m or --new-major` it will create a new major version for the block and a corresponding git branch.

_Protip_: `element publish -n "A NAME TO DISPLAY TO USERS" -c "OPTIONAL CATEGORY"`
_Protip_: `element publish -m`

* * *

### `element update`

After you make changes to your block, and are ready test to¬†them in the Site Designer, run this command from the root directory of the block. You'll likely run this command often.

### `element update --toggle-public`

There's only one optional flag for this command, and it's to make your initially-private block public, and available in the world.

_Protip_: `element update -p`

* * *

### `element release`

When you are ready to push your block live you can use this command.

### `element release --note "release note for the block`

There's only one optional flag for this command, and it's to add a release note to your block

_Protip_: `element update -n "release note for the block"`

* * *

### `element rollback`

If you have a problem with a release you can rollback to a previous release. The current release will be moved back to staging and the previous release will become active. If you rollback again it will remove the release from staging. You can continue to rollback until you only have your original release.

Each major version can be rolled back individually. However, you won't be able to rollback the inital published major version of the block.

* * *

### Adding a Thumbnail

Create a PNG file, ideally less than 100 kb in size, and save it in the root directory of the block as `thumbnail.png.` When publishing or updating your block, this file will be saved and then be shown in the Volusion store admin's [Site Designer](https://admin.volusion.com/designer).

### Getting CLI Help

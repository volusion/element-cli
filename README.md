## Installing

After [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), run

```bash
npm install -g @volusion/element-cli
```

## Using the CLI

### `element login`

The command for logging into the Element ecosystem. This is necessary for publishing and updating [blocks](https://github.com/volusion/element-tutorial#vocabulary).

Use the same credentials you use to log into your [Volusion store admin](https://admin.volusion.com).

* * *

### `element new NAME`

The command for scaffolding a new block. The command will clone the [Element Block Starter repo](https://github.com/volusion/element-blockstarter), allowing you to quickly get started with your development process.

* * *

### `element publish --name "A NAME TO DISPLAY TO USERS" --category "OPTIONAL CATEGORY"`

From the root directory of the block you intend to eventually make available to users of the Site Designer on the [Volusion store admin](https://admin.volusion.com).

By default, _newly-published blocks will only be visible to you and the other members of your organization_.

In the event that a `-c/--category` flag is not passed, you will be prompted with a list of valid Category names from which to select.

_Protip_: `element publish -n "A NAME TO DISPLAY TO USERS" -c "OPTIONAL CATEGORY"`

* * *

### `element update`

After you make changes to your block, and are ready test to¬†them in the Site Designer, run this command from the root directory of the block. You'll likely run this command often.

### `element update --toggle-public`

There's only one optional flag for this command, and it's to make your initially-private block public, and available in the world.

_Protip_: `element update -p`

* * *

### Adding a Thumbnail

Create a PNG file, ideally less than 100 kb in size, and save it in the root directory of the block as `thumbnail.png.` When publishing or updating your block, this file will be saved and then be shown in the Volusion store admin's [Site Designer](https://admin.volusion.com/designer).

### Getting CLI Help

```bash
element --help

# Or for individual commands, e.g.
element publish --help
```
